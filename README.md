# Rendermap 🎶🗺️

**Rendermap** is a prototype desktop app designed to make managing creative audio projects faster and more intuitive than using Windows Explorer.  
Instead of digging through endless folders, Rendermap automatically detects DAW renders (e.g., files with "render" in their name) and displays them in a 2D visual map.  
This helps producers build a "mental map" of their works-in-progress, making it easier to stay inspired and organized.
